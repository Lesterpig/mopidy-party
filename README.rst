Mopidy-Party
****************************

Mopidy web extension designed for party! Let your guests manage the sound ;)

- Minimal, fast web interface designed for mobile
- Search soundtracks and add it to the queue
- Skip current track (only if at least 1 min played from current track)

See this `blog entry <http://blog.lesterpig.com/2015/09/01/Build-a-connected-jukebox-from-a-Raspberry-Pi/>`_ for some details about this package.

Installation
============

You must install `mopidy <https://www.mopidy.com/>`_ and some backends (soundcloud, spofity, youtube...).

**PROD:** you just have to install pip and then::

    sudo pip install Mopidy-Party

**DEV:** After cloning the repository, install by running::

    sudo pip install -e .

Usage
=====

To use the interface, simply point your browser to your Mopidy instance's IP address at port 6680 to see all available web interfaces.
For example, http://192.168.0.2:6680/

Direct access to Mopidy Party would then be: http://192.168.0.2:6680/party/
